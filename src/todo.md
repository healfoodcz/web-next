# TODO

A central TODO list for upcoming functionalities.

Marks:
- (H) - high priority
- (M) - medium priority
- (L) - low priority

## (H) Add brand's favicon.ico
- favicon.light.ico and favicon.dark.ico should be loaded by next.js conditionally
- current problem: is it even possible? is the choosing between light and dark icons happening on server on client? is the client pulling the icon conditionally afterwards from the client side?

## (L) Use logger for server side actions?
